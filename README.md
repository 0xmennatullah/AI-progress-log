# My Learning Journey  

This repo documents my roadmap, progress, and notes while studying **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision**.  
It links to my projects, courses, and personal notes along the way.  

## Bases

1. [Cisco Python essentials 1,2](https://www.credly.com/users/mennatullah-khaled.b2f001d5)
2. [PyTorch for DL](https://github.com/0xmennatullah/PyTorch.git) 

## Machine Learning  

1. [ITI | ML Intro](https://github.com/0xmennatullah/iTi.git)
2. [ML Specialization | Andrew Ng](https://coursera.org/share/47ae73d67c4ac4acea577a5528e7765c)
3. [ML Implementations](https://github.com/0xmennatullah/ML-Implementation.git)  
4. Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue)   [📖 PDF](https://github.com/yanshengjia/ml-road/blob/master/resources/Hands%20On%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Scikit%20Learn%20and%20TensorFlow.pdf)  
   - [YT Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/feKKCXHjzfo?si=VRRLrptCpuqJxksl)
   - good walkthrough loss function concept.

## Deep Learning  

1. [Intro to DL (Kaggle Cert)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/menatullahkhaled/intro-to-deep-learning)
   - better model head function declarations  
   - ensemble methods explained nicely   

2. [Nvidia's Getting Started with Deep Learning](https://learn.nvidia.com/certificates?id=P55htmDaTb6a9p5p4cXo3w) 
   - nice attention and transformers explaination -embedding wise-.
   - implements some NLP l6.
   - very good explained labs.

3. [DL Implementations]()![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue) 
   
4. [Dive in Deeplearning Book](https://d2l.ai/)![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue)

5. [Andrew NG | MIT 2026 DL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZsU44qY66KgbeP3o&v=_NLHFoVNlbg&feature=youtu.be) ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue)

## Computer Vision  

1. [Intro to CV (Kaggle Cert)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/menatullahkhaled/computer-vision)  
   - good feature extraction breakdown  

2. [UMICH - DL for CV (2019)](https://github.com/0xmennatullah/Deep-learning-for-Computer-vision.git)
   - daydream explanation  
   - gradient ascent reviewed well
